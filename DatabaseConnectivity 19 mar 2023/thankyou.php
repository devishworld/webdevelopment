Congrats, dear students, you've reached the end
Of this course on web dev, my oh my, what a trend
From HTML to CSS,JavaScript, PHP and Database too
You've learned it all, and made it through

You started with the basics, the building blocks
A page with text, images, and some nice hocks
Then came the styles, the colors, and the fonts
Aesthetic and design, your creativity flaunts

But that is not enough, you need more
To make your pages interactive, to the core
JavaScript to the rescue, with its logic and code
Your websites now dynamic, a sight to behold

You built web applications, from scratch and with care
And deployed them online, for the world to share

Now you've reached the end, but it's just the start
Of your journey in web dev, a world full of art
Keep learning, keep growing, and never stop
Your skills will take you far, to the mountain top

So congrats again, dear students, on this day
You've made it through, in every possible way
Keep coding, keep building, and always be true
To your passion for web dev, and all that you do!
